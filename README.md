Aggregated Hawkes Processes
================

This GitHub repository contains the code and results associated with the Section 4 of the manuscript.

We provide this template as a default structure that we (the JASA Associate Editors of Reproducibility) think could be
useful for many projects, either as is or with modifications by authors.
However, the template is intended to be helpful and is by no means
required of authors. Authors should consult [our reproducibility
guide](https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide) for details on what is
required of reproducibility materials submitted with JASA revisions (not
required upon initial submission).

## Instructions for using the code

The purpose of this template repository is to provide a mechanism for
author(s) to share their materials via a Git repository, hosted on a
cloud-based repository manager such as GitHub or GitLab. This provides
the following advantages for author(s):

1.  Analyses (including code, narrative text, output, plots, etc) can be
    version controlled (or branched or forked) allowing original
    author(s) to continue to develop the analyses or other data analysts
    to build off the analyses. Also iterations and changes to the
    analysis are then available via the Git commit history.
2.  Materials are easily available to other researchers.
3.  Preparing a repository also makes it easy for the JASA Associate
    Editors for Reproducibility to copy the materials for a JASA article
    into the JASA GitHub repository where the final paper products are stored
    after publication (https://github.com/jasa-acs).

## How does the process work?

### Step 1

Author(s) can create a public GitHub repository in their own GitHub account
by using this template repository. This template contains a basic 
skeletal structure to help authors structure their code and analyses for their 
JASA publication. Creating a repository with the template can be done in the following way: 

Click on the "Use this template" button for [this GitHub template repository](https://github.com/jasa-acs/repro-template). (You'll need to be signed in to a GitHub account in order to see the button.)

From there, author(s) can [follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). However do not optionally select "**Include all branches**" as you do not need this for your own projects.
