This folder contains the results of simlations discussed in Section 4 of the manuscript.

* MCEM.dat: contains the estimation result for 400 simulations in the temporal case using the MC-EM method. 
* temporal.dat: contains the estimation results for 400 simulations in the temporal case using our method. 
* spatio_temporal.dat: contains the estimation results for 400 simulations in the spaio-temporal case using our method.
* multi_spatio_temporal.dat: contains the estimation results for 400 simulations in the multiple spaio-temporal case using our method.
