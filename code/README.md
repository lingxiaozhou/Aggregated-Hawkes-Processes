This folder contains all utility functions to run all the simulations for three scenarios we considered (temporal process, single spatio_temporal process and multiple spatio-temporal process).  The contents of this folder are as follows:

* aggregation.R: function for aggregating a continous Hawkes process
* combineMCMC.R: function that combines two MCMC chains
* generateHP.R: function for generating Hawkes processes
* initializalabel.R: function for initializing the branching structure
* MCMC_result.R: function for reading  result file
* MCMC_st.R: function that fit the model in the spatio-temporal case
* MCMC_t.R: function that fit the model in the temporal case
* simulationSource: function that sources all the necessary functions
* update_simulation: function that updates variables in the MCMC
